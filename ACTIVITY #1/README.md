The objective of this laboratory activity is to develop a sequential LED lighting system using an Arduino, where LEDs turn on and off in a specific order. 
The system can be customized to control either odd- or even-numbered LEDs separately. Multiple LEDs are connected to designated pins on the Arduino and are 
programmed to illuminate sequentially with a delay before turning off in the same sequence. The setup involves defining an array for LED pins, specifying 
the total number of LEDs, and configuring each pin as an output. The loop function manages the lighting sequence, allowing users to observe the LED transitions. 
To implement the project, LEDs must be connected to the appropriate pins, the provided code uploaded to the microcontroller, and the system executed, 
resulting in LEDs turning on and off at one-second intervals. Modifications can be made to the loop function to selectively control either 
odd- or even-numbered LEDs.
