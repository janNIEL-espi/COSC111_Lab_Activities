This laboratory activity focuses on developing a light detection system using a photoresistor and an LED, where the LED blinks if the ambient 
brightness exceeds a predefined threshold. The photoresistor measures light levels, while the LED serves as an alert indicator. The system 
continuously monitors brightness and displays real-time readings via the serial monitor. To implement the project, the photoresistor and LED 
must be connected to designated pins on the microcontroller, and the code should be uploaded using the Arduino IDE. Once running, the serial
monitor displays brightness values and system status, with the LED blinking when the threshold is exceeded. The blinking can be manually stopped 
by sending the command "stop" through the serial monitor.
